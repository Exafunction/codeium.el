# codeium.el

_Free, ultrafast, extensible AI code completion tool for Emacs_

Codeium autocompletes your code with AI in all major IDEs. We [launched](https://www.codeium.com/blog/codeium-copilot-alternative-in-emacs) this implementation of the Codeium plugin for Emacs to bring this modern coding superpower to more developers. Check out our [playground](https://www.codeium.com/playground) if you want to quickly try out Codeium online.

codeium.el provides a `completion-at-point-functions` backend. It is designed to be use with a front-end, such as [company-mode](https://company-mode.github.io/), [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu), or the built-in `completion-at-point`.

codeium.el is an open source client and (mostly) written by [Alan Chen](https://github.com/Alan-Chen99). It uses a proprietary language server binary, currently downloaded (automatically, with confirmation) from [here](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium/releases/). Use `M-x codeium-diagnose` to see apis/fields that would be sent to the local language server, and the command used to run the local language server. Customize `codeium-api-enabled`, `codeium-fields-regexps` and `codeium-command` to change them.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests and issues related to the package.

## üöÄ Getting started

1. Install [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

2. Install a text-completion frontend of your choice. (We recommend [company-mode](https://company-mode.github.io/) or [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu)).

3. Install `Exafunction/codeium.el` using your emacs package manager of
choice, or manually. See [Installation Options](#-installation-options) below.

4. Run `M-x codeium-install` to set up the package.

5. Add `codeium-completion-at-point` to your `completion-at-point-functions`.

6. Start seeing suggestions!

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can see all customization options via `M-x customize`.
(better documentation coming soon!)

Here is an example configuration:
```elisp
;; we recommend using use-package to organize your init.el
(use-package codeium
    ;; if you use straight
    ;; :straight '(:type git :host github :repo "Exafunction/codeium.el")
    ;; otherwise, make sure that the codeium.el file is on load-path

    :init
    ;; use globally
    (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'codeium-completion-at-point)
    ;; or on a hook
    ;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
    ;;     (lambda ()
    ;;         (setq-local completion-at-point-functions '(codeium-completion-at-point))))

    ;; if you want multiple completion backends, use cape (https://github.com/minad/cape):
    ;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
    ;;     (lambda ()
    ;;         (setq-local completion-at-point-functions
    ;;             (list (cape-super-capf #'codeium-completion-at-point #'lsp-completion-at-point)))))
    ;; an async company-backend is coming soon!

    ;; codeium-completion-at-point is autoloaded, but you can
    ;; optionally set a timer, which might speed up things as the
    ;; codeium local language server takes ~0.2s to start up
    ;; (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
    ;;  (lambda () (run-with-timer 0.1 nil #'codeium-init)))

    ;; :defer t ;; lazy loading, if you want
    :config
    (setq use-dialog-box nil) ;; do not use popup boxes

    ;; if you don't want to use customize to save the api-key
    ;; (setq codeium/metadata/api_key "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")

    ;; get codeium status in the modeline
    (setq codeium-mode-line-enable
        (lambda (api) (not (memq api '(CancelRequest Heartbeat AcceptCompletion)))))
    (add-to-list 'mode-line-format '(:eval (car-safe codeium-mode-line)) t)
    ;; alternatively for a more extensive mode-line
    ;; (add-to-list 'mode-line-format '(-50 "" codeium-mode-line) t)

    ;; use M-x codeium-diagnose to see apis/fields that would be sent to the local language server
    (setq codeium-api-enabled
        (lambda (api)
            (memq api '(GetCompletions Heartbeat CancelRequest GetAuthToken RegisterUser auth-redirect AcceptCompletion))))
    ;; you can also set a config for a single buffer like this:
    ;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
    ;;     (lambda ()
    ;;         (setq-local codeium/editor_options/tab_size 4)))

    ;; You can overwrite all the codeium configs!
    ;; for example, we recommend limiting the string sent to codeium for better performance
    (defun my-codeium/document/text ()
        (buffer-substring-no-properties (max (- (point) 3000) (point-min)) (min (+ (point) 1000) (point-max))))
    ;; if you change the text, you should also change the cursor_offset
    ;; warning: this is measured by UTF-8 encoded bytes
    (defun my-codeium/document/cursor_offset ()
        (codeium-utf8-byte-length
            (buffer-substring-no-properties (max (- (point) 3000) (point-min)) (point))))
    (setq codeium/document/text 'my-codeium/document/text)
    (setq codeium/document/cursor_offset 'my-codeium/document/cursor_offset))
```


Here is an example configuration for company-mode.
```elisp
(use-package company
    :defer 0.1
    :config
    (global-company-mode t)
    (setq-default
        company-idle-delay 0.05
        company-require-match nil
        company-minimum-prefix-length 0

        ;; get only preview
        company-frontends '(company-preview-frontend)
        ;; also get a drop down
        ;; company-frontends '(company-pseudo-tooltip-frontend company-preview-frontend)
        ))
```

You can also access codeium.el from elisp; here is a snippet that returns
the full response of a `GetCompletions` request:
```elisp
(cl-letf*
    (
        ;; making a new codeium-state (thus a new local language server process)
        ;; takes ~0.2 seconds; avoid when possible
        (state (codeium-state-make :name "example"))
        ((codeium-config 'codeium/document/text state) "def fibi(n):")
        ((codeium-config 'codeium/document/cursor_offset state) 12)
        ((codeium-config 'codeium-api-enabled state) (lambda (api) (eq api 'GetCompletions))))
    (unwind-protect
        (progn
            (codeium-init state)
            ;; make async requests using codeium-request
            (cdr (codeium-request-synchronously 'GetCompletions state nil)))
        ;; cleans up temp files, kill process. Scheduled async requests on this state will be dropped.
        (codeium-reset state)))
```
Note that, among other things, you get probabilities for each token!
We would love to see a PR or your own package that uses those!
